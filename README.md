## Real-Time Bidding by Reinforcement Learning in Display Advertising with Return on Investment


## Instructions on on to run our code
To see the evaluation result, please run under the folder of **scripts**:
```bash
$ bash small-scale.sh
```
or run under the folder of **python**:
```bash
$ python3 bid_ss.py
```

Note these results are produced from a subset (the first 350,000 lines of each campaign in iPinYou) under T = 1000 and c0 = 1/32.
For the full small-scale evaluation and large-scale evaluation, please first check the GitHub project [make-ipinyou-data](https://github.com/wnzhang/make-ipinyou-data "make-ipinyou-data") for pre-processing the [iPinYou data](http://data.computational-advertising.org "iPinYou data"). 
After downloading the dataset, by "make all" you can generate the standardised data.
